## Overview

**Project Title**:

OCR (Optical Character Recognition) Digits

**Project Description**:

Train a model for hand drawn (with a mouse) digits and use it for testing.

**Project Goals**:

Learn basic machine learning techniques.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. To add more trainig data: `python ocr_trainer.py`
2. To rebuild the model from the training data: `python ocr_model.py`
3. To test the model: `python ocr_tester.py`

Key Files:
* `ocr.dat` - Training Data
* `ocr.mdl` - Model

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Python 3.13
* `numpy==2.2.6`
* `pandas==2.3.0`
* `scikit_learn==1.6.1`
